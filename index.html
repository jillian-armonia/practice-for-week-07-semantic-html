        <h1>My HTML Cheat Sheet</h1>

        <h2>Headings</h2>

        <p>
            Headings with tags from 'h1' to 'h6' are used for titles, headings, and subheadings. By using the appropriate tags, you can optimize the searchability of your website. You might be tempted to use h1 because it draws attention, but it should only be used for the title. Headings can help identify blocks and sections.
        </p>

        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>

        <p>
            Paragraphs are also block elements like headings, but they contain more long-form content. They have the 'p' tags.
        </p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
        <p>
            Unordered lists have the 'ul' tags. Each list item has a bullet point. Each list item goes under the 'li' tag.
        </p>

        <h4>Types of lists:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unordered lists (`ul`)</li>
            <li>Ordered lists (`ol`)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
        <p>
            Ordered lists have the 'ol' tags. Each list item will be numbered, starting from 1. Each list item also goes under the 'li' tag.
        </p>

        <h4>Polya's Problem Solving Framework</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand the problem</li>
            <li>Come up with a plan</li>
            <li>Carry out the plan</li>
            <li>Go back and improve your solution</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Anchors (i.e. links)</h2>
        <p>
            Anchor element has an 'a' tag. It is used to put links to a different webpage in your website. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">
                Go to DuckDuckGo to search for more information.
              </a>
        </p>

        <p>Setting your target attribute to "_blank" will open a new window when you click the link. See <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/a" target="_blank">MDN</a> for more details.</p>

        <h2>Images</h2>

        <p>
            You can use the img tag to add images to your page.
            <img src="http://wanderlord.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Lemur-5-150x150.jpg" alt="A cute lemur">
          </p>

        <h2>Tables</h2>
        <p>
            Tables are a great way to organize and show data on your webpage. Start with a 'table' tag. Then inside the 'table' tag, use the 'thead' tag to create a header row for your table. Use the 'tbody' tag for the main content of your table. Lastly, use the 'tfoot' tag for the footer row of your table.
        </p>

        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="col">Insect</th>
                    <th scope="col">Family</th>
                    <th scope="col">Fact</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="row">Ladybug</th>
                    <td>Coccinellidae</td>
                    <td>Can eat more than 5,000 insects!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="row">Fruit flies</th>
                    <td>Drosophilidae</td>
                    <td>First living creatures in outer space!</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <th scope="row">Caterpillars</th>
                    <td>Heterobathmiidae</td>
                    <td>Have 12 eyes!</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
            <tfoot>
                <tr>
                    <td></td>
                    <td>I had no idea!</td>
                    <td>Those are neat!</td>
                </tr>
            </tfoot>
        </table>

        <p>
            Use 'tr' tags to add rows in your table. Use 'th' to indicate that it is a column or row header through the scope attribute. Use 'td' tag to put your data. This is how you make tables.
        </p>

        <h2>Articles</h2>

        <p>
            The article element is a self-contained composition that can easily be distributed or copied. This can be forum posts, widgets, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Footer</h2>

        <p>
            The footer element is always at the end of the page. It usually contains links for navigation or other webpages for more information.
        </p>

        <h2>Header</h2>

        <p>
            Not to be confused with headings, the header is a section that introduces the page and usually has the navigation links here. It might contain the logo and information about the author.
        </p>

        <h2>Nav</h2>

        <p>
            The nav element, or navigation element, contains links to all the other webpages in your website.
        </p>

        <h2>How to Make a Form</h2>

        <h3>Tips on Designing Your Form</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Make it simple and focused.</li>
            <li>Avoid spacing your form and making it big.</li>
            <li>Listen to a screen reader to check how the form structure sounds like.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Form Elements</h3>

        <h4>Form</h4>

        <p>
            You can use the 'form' tag. It is like the container element and configures how this section behaves. The action attribute is the link to where the data collected is sent to. The method attribute is the link what HTTP method is gonna be used.
        </p>

        <h4>Label</h4>

        <p>
            The label element helps with giving names and levels to each input field in the form. You can use the 'label' tag with the for attribute for the corresponding input.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can wrap a 'p' tag around the 'label' and 'input' tags to help with styling it.
        </p>

        <h4>Input</h4>

        <p>
            This is a self-closing tag. Using the type attribute, you can set the what type of input you need from the client. If you use email, it will only accept email addresses from the client.
        </p>

        <h4>Text Area</h4>

        <p>
            This is not a self-closing tag like input. It's a long form text input. You can use this for long comments.
        </p>

        <h4>Button</h4>

        <p>
            Clicking this element, you can submit your form.
        </p>

        <h3>Structural Element for Forms</h3>

        <h4>Fieldsets</h4>

        <p>
            This acts like a section inside your form element. It helps organize a set of choices, especially when you are putting radio-type input.
        </p>

        <h4>Legends</h4>

        <p>
            This is a special label for the fieldset. It acts as fieldset header.
        </p>
