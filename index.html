        <h2>Headings</h2>

        <p>
            Headings with tags from 'h1' to 'h6' are used for titles, headings, and subheadings. By using the appropriate tags, you can optimize the searchability of your website. You might be tempted to use h1 because it draws attention, but it should only be used for the title. Headings can help identify blocks and sections.
        </p>

        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>

        <p>
            Paragraphs are also block elements like headings, but they contain more long-form content. They have the 'p' tags.
        </p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <h3>Unordered Lists</h3>
        <p>
            Unordered lists have the 'ul' tags. Each list item has a bullet point. Each list item goes under the 'li' tag.
        </p>

        <h4>Types of lists:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Unordered lists (`ul`)</li>
            <li>Ordered lists (`ol`)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Ordered Lists</h3>
        <p>
            Ordered lists have the 'ol' tags. Each list item will be numbered, starting from 1. Each list item also goes under the 'li' tag.
        </p>

            <li>Come up with a plan</li>
            <li>Carry out the plan</li>
            <li>Go back and improve your solution</li>

        </ol>

        <h2>Anchors (i.e. links)</h2>
        <p>
            Anchor element has an 'a' tag. It is used to put links to a different webpage in your website. <a href="https://duckduckgo.com">
