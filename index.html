        <h2>Headings</h2>

        <p>Headings with tags from 'h1' to 'h6' are used for titles, headings, and subheadings. By using the appropriate tags, you can optimize the searchability of your website. You might be tempted to use h1 because it draws attention, but it should only be used for the title. Headings can help identify blocks and sections</p>

        <h2>Paragraphs</h2>

        <p>Paragraphs are also block elements like headings, but they contain more long-form content. They have the 'p' tags</p>

        <h2>Lists</h2>

        <ul>
            <li></li>
        </ul>
